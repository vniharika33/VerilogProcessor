# VerilogProcessor

Verilog implementation of SingleCycle TinyRISC processor.

To execute it and see the output wave open these files in Xilinx Vivado and click on run simulation.

We have already given some testcases in testbenches of all the units. The same format must be followed for giving other inputs.

The testbench files and source files are there in VerilogProcessor.srcs

We have also given different testbenches for different units in order to verify properly.It is showing correct output when checked this way.

Sample output :
